#! /usr/bin/env python
# File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV] format.
# This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
# 1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns
# names of top performer students
# >>> python
# def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
#     pass
# print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
# >>> ['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider',
# 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']
# 2) Implement a function which receives the file path with students info and
# writes CSV student information to the new file in descending order of age.
# Result:
# student name,age,average mark
# Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
# Brenda Silva,30,7.53
# ...
# Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
# Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
